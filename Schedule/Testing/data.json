  "abstract":"Tim O'Reilly once passed along an observation from Broderbund founder Doug Carlston: \"We consider a productivity application to be any application where the user's own data matters more to him than the data we provide.\"\n\nThe iPad is an absurdly wonderful device for this kind of application: big touch screen for drawing/designing/writing, gigs of storage, wireless networking to put your work in Dropbox or iCloud, and multi-core CPUs to grind through the heavy lifting. And don't let the lack of a user-visible file system fool you: inside the SDK, there is deep support for writing world-class applications to create, manage, edit, export, and distribute the user's data. Cut/copy/paste, import/export, rip/mix/burn, it's all there. But how do you find it, and how do you put the pieces together?\n\nIn this all-day tutorial, we'll look at the most essential SDKs for writing apps that let users make the most of their data, whether it's words, pictures, numbers, or media. We'll cover:\n\n...plus more neat tricks to make our users more productive.",
